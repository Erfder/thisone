                    <h4>Serebii.net's image viewer</h4>
                    <img src="i/spp.png">
                    <p>This image viewer overlays a shadow on top of the usual content of the page. It also has very obvious button functionality, as well as a simple title/number textbox below the image. When it is opened, it plays an animation that stretches it into being the larger size. This focuses attention on the image the user wants to view, and magnifies it to make it easier.</p>

                    <h4>Twitter's "Compose new tweet" box</h4>
                    <img src="i/twitter.png">
                    <p>Similar to the image box described above, the buttons are very simple, colors are customizable, and it greys out the main page for focal emphasis. It is designed for anyone using the site (obviously, but there isn't really any other target audience). In that regard, it satisfies the need to share something quick. You click a button, start typing, and press the "Tweet" button.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Pokemon's call to action</h4>
                    <img src="i/pkmn.png">
                    <p>This is ridiculously simple. It is directly below the results of a poll (which is a paragraph and 1 image that take up the entire width of the screen). It has three options, all of which are just an image and three to five words. Yet you have an idea of what each might do, and it is organized quite well. The target audience is really anyone, but with children in primary forethought. Having nice visuals with few words and options works quite well for them. Anyone on this page is really just browsing, and these can give them something to do.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Youtube's menu system</h4>
                    <img src="i/yt.png">
                    <p>This menu is designed for people who want to watch something as opposed to upload or create. It is completely hidden until you click on the menu icon (upper center on the screenshot), and files like items into separate bins. For example, all the playlists are contained together, all the subscriptions are together, etc. This is effective at satisfying the user's expectations because it makes it easier to find things to watch without needing to search a specific keyword.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Lost Worlds Fair's footer</h4>
                    <img src="i/footer.png">
                    <p>Anyone looking at the footer of a website is more likely than not trying to find out more information or attempting to contact the company. The reason I chose this one is because it is visually pleasing. Not many footers are; they are often lists of links with little to no styling. Instead, this footer has a few graphics that sort of tie up the site, along with people and their information. The entire site's graphics are also cohesive, footer included.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Music City's Contact page</h4>
                    <img src="i/side.png">
                    <p>The target audience of this site is readily obvious, and the contact form on this page creates a feeling of professional informality. It is designed well, with the ripped paper edge, handwriting type font, and the guitar picture makes it feel almost as if you were writing an actual letter to them. The design choice and graphics are warm and inviting, and a portion of the site can still be seen off to the side.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Equestria Daily's nav bar</h4>
                    <img src="i/eqd.png">
                    <p>The target audience here is a person who wants to discover media or news based around My Little Pony. The options are separated into sub-menus that dropdown upon hover, so that refining the categories isn't overwhelming at first glance. The color scheme is primarily what draws me to it; black and grey with white text has high contrast, and the categories are color-coded. The many colors are not an eye sore and work well with each other and the rest of the nav bar. It also fits the site theme because one appeal of the show is the color, and therefore colorful components are fitting.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Kickstarter's information display</h4>
                    <img src="i/ks.png">
                    <p>This site is designed to find, and contribute to, interesting or influential projects. Shown here is the title and person or team heading the project, below is an informational video, and funding info is to the right. What makes this work is the visual hierarchy at play. To see this screen you had already clicked the title, so the title isn't super important at this point, but still a key item. It therefore is normal font in a medium size. The key parts of their goal stand out in a large, bold font, with labels being small bold type. The call to action is the only thing (besides the video) to have color in this section, drawing attention to it. This display is very concise. Not shown here is the list of projects, filtered by category. I mention this because the pledge goal is visually represented with a progress bar, quickly demonstrating where it is at in its goal.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Hot Topic's sign up page</h4>
                    <img src="i/ht.png">
                    <p>Hot Topic caters primarily to music and pop culture fans. I feel this sign up page is excellent because the branding graphic and text indicate the mood of the site. "we reserve the right to completely rock your world" is a nice touch to it. Besides tone, this is also effective in its at-a-glance simplicity. The create an account form is not on the page, thus the only thing immediately required for sign up is to click the button. This makes the page a lot less cluttered and simplistic. The call to action is also at the top, before you see the join/login.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>I Shot Him's header</h4>
                    <img src="i/head1.png">
                    <img src="i/head2.png">
                    <img src="i/Head3.png">
                    <p>This is a designer-based site, so the home page here clearly demonstrates this with the photo. What is interesting about this site, though, is that the first image is the header and home page; as you scroll down, the body of the document slowly overlaps the image. Then a functional header transitions into view, shown in the third image. This is unique and stresses the design of the site, to essentially show they know what they are doing.</p>
